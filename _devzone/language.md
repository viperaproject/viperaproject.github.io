Adding a new programming language to **Vipera** can be as easy as adding a new parser to the **Olympus** native code generation framework. If additional languages features over and above those provided by **Olympus** are required, these can be easily added to the framework. New types can be added to the _Abstract Syntax Tree_ (AST), along with supporting additional code generation functions.
