# vPython
vPython is an implementation of Python, on top of the Vipera framework, specially designed for micro-core architectures. vPython codes can be executed via both a tiny interpreter (approx. 24KB) and AOT[^1] native compilation. vPython enables Python programmers to easily offload specific kernels in their code onto micro-core accelerators, with the seamless transfer of code and data to the device, as well as the copying back of results from the device. As micro-core devices have very small memory spaces (around 32KB to 64KB), Vipera provides the ability to take advantage of the larger, albeit slower, external memories to support usable datasets on the devices, and abstracts over the low-level details required to transfer data on the different devices.
